    "# Web Scraping Using Python\n",
    "1. The program is using the BeautifulSoup to extract all the data from \"https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/\". \n",
    "2. With the help of html tags like class, the program is sorting the required data and storing it into a text format.\n",
    "3. Then using indexing, string and list slicing, the data for each stock have been stored into specific variables as expained in the comments\n",
    "4. The program is getting all the stock details like Previous close, Open, Volume and Market Capital from 'https://finance.yahoo.com/' and storing the data into specific variables\n",
    "4. After that, the program will write the data into csv file named 'stocks.csv'\n",
    "5. Then, the program opens the csv file and extract data from it. Stored in specific variables\n",
    "6. Then, program will ask to enter the ticker symbol from user. If the input is incorrect, program will ask to enter the symbol again.\n",
    "7. Upon receiving correct ticker symbol, the program will give the stock information which is required.\n",
    "8. User has to type in 'done' to get out of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - 1. The program is using list concatenating to return the value of 'Volume' from the data extracted from 'https://finance.yahoo.com/'. Since the most of the volume figures are greater than 6 digits i.e. they are separated by by atleast 3 commas, if the value of the 'Volume' is less than or equal to 6 digits, then the program will not be able to concatenate the elements and the desired output would not be achieved.                                    \n",
    "Note - 2. User has to enter 'done' in input to end the run of the program. If you enter any wrong value, the program will throw error message and ask you to enter correct value."
